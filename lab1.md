# Lab Report 1
## Using `cd`
1. With**out** arguments
  ```
  kyang@Kellys-MacBook-Air ~ % cd
  kyang@Kellys-MacBook-Air ~ %
  ```
  * **Absolute path**: `/Users/kyang`
  * I got this output because `cd` is meant to change the current working directory. However, I didn't provide a path, so nothing happened.
  * While the output isn't an error, `cd` expects a path to a directory. 


2. With path to a **directory** as an argument
     ```
     kyang@Kellys-MacBook-Air ~ % cd lecture1
     kyang@Kellys-MacBook-Air lecture1 %
     ```
  * **Absolute path**: `/Users/kyang/lecture1`
  * I got this output because `cd` changes the current working directory to the given path. Everything before the `%` shows that my current working directory is now `lecture1`.
  * This output is not an error.
