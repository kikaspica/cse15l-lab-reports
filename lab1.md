## Using `cd`
1. With**out** arguments
  ```
  kyang@Kellys-MacBook-Air ~ % cd
  kyang@Kellys-MacBook-Air ~ %
  ```
  * **Absolute path**: `/Users/kyang`
  * I got this output because `cd` is meant to change the current working directory. However, I didn't provide a path, so nothing happened.
  * While the output isn't an error, `cd` expects a path to a directory. 

3. With path to a **directory** as an argument
4. With a path to a **file** as an argument
